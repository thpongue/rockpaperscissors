		- [x] background
			- [x] background - red/blue background with white line divider
			- [x] header - 'player1' vs 'player2' hardcoded with 'Vs' in a circle in between

		- [x] basic game
			- [x] once both players have selected:
				- [x] show text showing "winner", "Loser" or "No winner" (for draw)
				- [x] show no text (winner, loser or draw) if there is no result
				- [x] bug: by default we always mark players as winners at the start
			- [x] bug: players on different urls seem to affect each other
			- [x] bug: on connect we need to tell all the clients to re-update the others about their state
			- [x] refreshing loses the current selection - store last selection in a cookie
			- [x] bug: getting the current selection from the cookie should take into account which player - currently any new player who joins also gets this value
			- [x] bug: cookies get overwritten by another game on the same machine. When both players have selected refresh the first one to select and her choice will be gone

	- [] unsorted
		- have e2e running on watch in phantom
		- sass messing up wrecks watch and js sometimes does it too - dunno why though
		- consider symlinking back end and front end into one location
		- full build isn't closing
		- A/B test whether people will put their friends email addresses in - this gives us the ability to send cool, branded invites
		- is there a better way to make socket.io accesible to Angular than making it global?
		- handle unrecognised game id's
		- my project shouldn't copy into back end but copy into its own folder
		- one-command watch from the root - maybe need to rename watch to front_end_watch and back_end_watch
		- find a unit testing DI syntax that I like and stick to it with all unit tests
		- use sinon? (this would also help the other stuff we're testing) or jasmine.createSpy
		- rename background to player or something - its not a background
		- improve naming in controller - game index and player index is a little unclear. Rename the game index to view index
		- naming is very confusing around registration
		- look at making the e2e tests more readable and with less repeated code
		- move localPersistence to services
		- repetition in unit tests makes them unwieldy - try to refactor them to remove duplication as I go (not as a seperate job at the end)
		- use something like this for the winner: http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/0/7/b/global_438177467.jpeg
		- isWinner, isNoResult, isDraw could be a single value - this has become complicated
	- [] tech debt
		- back end testing is only covered by e2e tests
		- e2e tests should include testing for the recently fixed bug: have 2 players, both select RP or S, refresh the first player and the cookie hasn't stored the value
