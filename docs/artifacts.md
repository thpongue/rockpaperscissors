	- [] unsorted
		- have e2e running on watch in phantom
		- sass messing up wrecks watch and js sometimes does it too - dunno why though
		- consider symlinking back end and front end into one location
		- full build isn't closing
		- back-end needs a dummy version of all dependencies
		- support custom "named" games - ie don't use GUUID
		- A/B test whether people will put their friends email addresses in - this gives us the ability to send cool, branded invites
		- is there a better way to make socket.io accesible to Angular than making it global?
		- handle unrecognised game id's
		- is it possible to bdd test this by launching multiple windows / tabs?
		- my project shouldn't copy into back end but copy into its own folder
		- one-command watch from the root - maybe need to rename watch to front_end_watch and back_end_watch
		- find a unit testing DI syntax that I like and stick to it with all unit tests
		- use sinon? (this would also help the other stuff we're testing) or jasmine.createSpy
		- rename background to player or something - its not a background
	- [] tech debt
		- back end testing is only covered by e2e tests
